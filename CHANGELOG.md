v1.1.1: Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Inspector

v1.1.0: Contact Size Optimizations

- __Breaking Change:__ Solidity 0.8.4 is now required to compile the contracts
  (previously was 0.4.22 for the core contract and 0.6.2 for periphery contracts).
- Replaced "access denied" error with string literal (0.4.22) with the custom error AccessDenied() (0.8.4)
- Introduced lighter modification of the "AccessControl" RBAC contract â€“ "AccessControlCore" (RBAC-C).
  The 'core' version of the RBAC contract hides three rarely used external functions from the public ABI,
  making them internal and thus reducing the overall compiled implementation size.

  | old name             | old modifier | new name              | new modifier |
  |----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|
  | `isFeatureEnabled()` | `public`     | `isFeatureEnabled()`  | `internal`   |
  | `isSenderInRole()`   | `public`     | `_isSenderInRole()`   | `internal`   |
  | `isOperatorInRole()` | `public`     | `_isOperatorInRole()` | `internal`   |

- Added `_requireSenderInRole()` and `_requireAccessCondition()` internal functions for a convenient and gas-efficient
  way of checking the access permissions and throwing the AccessDenied() error.
- Added the CHANGELOG (this file)
